          <h1>Homework Lab Activity</h1>
            <p>In this assignment, I analyzed five different types of framework architectures and identified real-world websites or 
              applications that utilize each.The goal was to understand how these architectures function and apply them to 
              commonly used digital platforms.This homework allowed me to connect theoretical frameworks with actual technologies in use today,
               enhancing my understanding of how these architectures function in real-world applications.
